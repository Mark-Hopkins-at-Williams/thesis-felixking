\section{Motivation}

Machine translation tasks rely heavily on the availability of parallel training data -- sentences in one language and their 
translations in the other. For many langauge pairs, hundreds of thousands of high-quality sentence pairs are available. But there 
are hundreds of languages which have only been translated into one or two other languages, if any at all. Any translation task 
involving one of these "low-resource" languages (ASK: can we call languages low resource or just language pairs?) is doomed to 
produce a low-quality result at best.
