348:	In spite of his success, Warner Bros. had no interest in raising Bogart's profile.

391:	Despite the acrimony, the film was successful; according to a review in The New York Times, Bogart was "incredibly adroit ... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show".

460:	Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller Morituri in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience.
461:	Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand and based on the 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin.
462:	In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations."

476:	Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'"

482:	Pauline Kael, in The New Yorker review, wrote "The movie breakthrough has finally come.
483:	In 1973, Brando was devastated by the death of his childhood best friend Wally Cox.

563:	Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.
564:	However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today.
565:	Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the "father of history" in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the "father of lies".
566:	In Middle English, the meaning of history was "story" in general.
567:	In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".
568:	In the words of Benedetto Croce, "All history is contemporary history".
569:	Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").
570:	The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences.
571:	In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.
572:	In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.
573:	Archaeological finds rarely stand alone, with narrative sources complementing its discoveries.
574:	For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA, has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents idealizing "liberty" and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth made apparent by the study of the total historical environment.
575:	It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization.
576:	Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the philosophy of history.
577:	By whom was it produced (authorship)?
578:	What is the evidential value of its contents (credibility)?
579:	The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.
580:	Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention (though Herodotus was not wholly committed to this idea himself).
581:	There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China.
582:	Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.
583:	Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.
584:	The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past.
585:	His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,H. Mowlana (2001). "

607:	History of the Americas is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
608:	History of the Caribbean begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.

611:	History of Southeast Asia has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

613:	It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people.
614:	This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time.

617:	At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed.
618:	The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War.

620:	Many view the field from both perspectives.
621:	In the United States, textbooks published by the same company often differ in content from state to state.
622:	Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.
623:	A civilization (or civilisation) is a complex society that is characterized by urban development, social stratification, a form of government, and symbolic systems of communication (such as writing).
624:	In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers; however, sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves.
625:	The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias's The Civilizing Process (1939), which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the Early Modern period.
626:	Related words like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century.
627:	In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, "civilization" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole.
628:	Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.
629:	Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original discursive or prerational natural unity" (see noble savage).
630:	Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits.
631:	All civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.
632:	Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time.
633:	However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture.
634:	The word "civilization" is sometimes simply defined as "'living in cities'".
635:	State societies are more stratified than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes.
636:	Civilizations, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments.
637:	Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land.
638:	By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions.
639:	These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time.
640:	The transition from simpler to more complex economies does not necessarily mean an improvement in the living standards of the populace.
641:	The average stature of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its access to necessities, especially food.
642:	Like money, the writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other.
643:	These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology.
644:	These cultures are called by some "primitive", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. "
645:	Anthropologists today use the term "non-literate" to describe these peoples.
646:	But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.
647:	Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite.
648:	The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.
649:	The aim is to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the case of war and armed conflict.
650:	Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler,Spengler, Oswald, Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History (1919) uses the German word Kultur, "culture", for what many call a "civilization".
651:	Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".
652:	Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.
653:	For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres.
654:	During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.
655:	Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways.
656:	Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century.
657:	This encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts – a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.
658:	This area has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of the cursive script".
659:	This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.
660:	The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism, the domestication of grains and animals, the permanence of settlements and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.
661:	Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
662:	For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.
663:	Theodor Mommsen in his History of Rome suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".
664:	Arnold J. Toynbee in his A Study of History suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen.
665:	During the intermediate phase, the increasing population growth leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state.
666:	Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.
667:	The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire.
668:	He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
669:	The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations.
670:	Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it.
671:	Cultural Historian Morris Berman suggests in Dark Ages America: the End of Empire that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable.
672:	The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.
673:	This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources.
674:	In the graphic, Ma means "million years ago".)
675:	Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism.
676:	Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale.
677:	It is estimated that 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, over five billion, have gone extinct.
678:	The Earth's crust has constantly changed since its formation, as has life since its first appearance.
679:	The Moon is formed around this time probably due to a protoplanet's collision into Earth.
680:	The atmosphere is composed of volcanic and greenhouse gases.
681:	Bacteria begin producing oxygen, shaping the third and current of Earth's atmospheres.
682:	The early continents of Columbia, Rodinia and Pannotia, in that order, may have existed in this eon.
683:	Gradually, life expands to land and familiar forms of plants, animals and fungi begin appearing, including annelids, insects and reptiles, hence the eon's name, which means "visible life".
684:	It was composed of hydrogen and helium created shortly after the Big Bang 13.8 Ga (billion years ago) and heavier elements ejected by supernovae.
685:	As the cloud began to accelerate, its angular momentum, gravity, and inertia flattened it into a protoplanetary disk perpendicular to its axis of rotation.
686:	After more contraction, a T Tauri star ignited and evolved into the Sun.
687:	Earth formed in this manner about 4.54 billion years ago (with an uncertainty of 1%) and was largely completed within 10–20 million years.
688:	The proto-Earth grew by accretion until its interior was hot enough to melt the heavy, siderophile metals.
689:	From crater counts on other celestial bodies, it is inferred that a period of intense meteorite impacts, called the Late Heavy Bombardment, began about 4.1 Ga, and concluded around 3.8 Ga, at the end of the Hadean.
690:	By the beginning of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly.
691:	New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48 ± 0.02 Ga, or 70–110 million years after the start of the Solar System.
692:	The collision released about 100 million times more energy than the more recent Chicxulub impact that is believed to have caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.
693:	The giant impact hypothesis predicts that the Moon was depleted of metallic material, explaining its abnormal composition.
694:	The initial crust, formed when the Earth's surface first solidified, totally disappeared from a combination of this fast Hadean plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the Late Heavy Bombardment.
695:	These pieces of late Hadean and early Archean crust form the cores around which today's continents grew.
696:	Cratons consist primarily of two alternating types of terranes.
697:	For this reason, greenstones are sometimes seen as evidence for subduction during the Archean.
698:	Now it is considered likely that many of the volatiles were delivered during accretion by a process known as impact degassing in which incoming bodies vaporize on impact.
699:	Planetesimals at a distance of 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long.
700:	Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming as early as 4.4 Ga. By the start of the Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth.
701:	Thus, the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.
702:	There are many models, but little consensus, on how life emerged from non-living chemicals; chemical systems created in the laboratory fall well short of the minimum complexity for a living organism.
703:	Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules.
704:	RNA would later have been replaced by DNA, which is more stable and therefore can build longer genomes, expanding the range of capabilities a single organism can have.
705:	A difficulty with the metabolism-first scenario is finding a way for organisms to evolve.
706:	Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of fatty acids into "bubbles", and that the bubbles could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay.
707:	This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today.
708:	The change to an oxygen-rich atmosphere was a crucial development.
709:	They used fermentation, the breakdown of more complex compounds into less complex compounds with less energy, and used the energy so liberated to grow and reproduce.
710:	Most of the life that covers the surface of the Earth depends directly or indirectly on photosynthesis.
711:	To supply the electrons in the circuit, hydrogen is stripped from water, leaving oxygen as a waste product.
712:	The simpler anoxygenic form arose about 3.8 Ga, not long after the appearance of life.
713:	At first, the released oxygen was bound up with limestone, iron, and other minerals.
714:	Though each cell only produced a minute amount of oxygen, the combined metabolism of many cells over a vast time transformed Earth's atmosphere to its current state.
715:	The ozone layer absorbed, and still absorbs, a significant amount of the ultraviolet radiation that once had passed through the atmosphere.
716:	As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the Proterozoic eon.
717:	Glacial deposits found in South Africa date back to 2.2 Ga, at which time, based on paleomagnetic evidence, they must have been located near the equator.
718:	The Huronian ice age might have been caused by the increased oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, which caused the decrease of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere.
719:	However, the term Snowball Earth is more commonly used to describe later extreme ice ages during the Cryogenian period.
720:	Carbon dioxide combines with rain to weather rocks to form carbonic acid, which is then washed out to sea, thus extracting the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.
721:	The Bacteria domain probably first split off from the other forms of life (sometimes called Neomura), but this supposition is controversial.
722:	The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic era, some 2.4 ago; these multicellular benthic organisms had filamentous structures capable of anastomosis.
723:	Perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed (possibly due to the evolution of prey defenses).
724:	Using oxygen, it metabolized the larger cell's waste products and derived more energy.
725:	Soon, a stable symbiosis developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it.
726:	A similar event occurred with photosynthetic cyanobacteria entering large heterotrophic cells and becoming chloroplasts.
727:	Besides the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, there are theories that cells led to peroxisomes, spirochetes led to cilia and flagella, and that perhaps a DNA virus led to the cell nucleus, though none of them are widely accepted.
728:	Around 1.1 Ga, the supercontinent Rodinia was assembling.
729:	Although the division between a colony with specialized cells and a multicellular organism is not always clear, around 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular plants emerged, probably green algae.
730:	Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna.
731:	About 1000 to 830 Ma, most continental mass was united in the supercontinent Rodinia.
732:	The hypothetical supercontinent is sometimes referred to as Pannotia or Vendia.
733:	The intensity and mechanism of both glaciations are still under investigation and harder to explain than the early Proterozoic Snowball Earth.
734:	Because CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, climates cooled globally.
735:	Increased volcanic activity resulted from the break-up of Rodinia at about the same time.
736:	The new forms of life, called Ediacara biota, were larger and more diverse than ever.
737:	It consists of three eras: The Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and is the time when multi-cellular life greatly diversified into almost all the organisms known today.
738:	This causes the sea level to rise.
739:	Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana.
740:	The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica).
741:	The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America.
742:	Whereas the Ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group, at the end of the Cambrian most modern phyla were already present.
743:	Some of these Cambrian groups appear complex but are seemingly quite different from modern life; examples are Anomalocaris and Haikouichthys.
744:	A creature that could have been the ancestor of the fishes, or was probably closely related to it, was Pikaia.
745:	Fish, the earliest vertebrates, evolved in the oceans around 530 Ma.
746:	The oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480–460 Ma, though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000 Ma and the plants 700 Ma.
747:	Fins evolved to become limbs that the first tetrapods used to lift their heads out of the water to breathe air.
748:	Eventually, some of them became so well adapted to terrestrial life that they spent their adult lives on land, although they hatched in the water and returned to lay their eggs.
749:	Plants evolved seeds, which dramatically accelerated their spread on land, around this time (by approximately 360 Ma).
750:	Another 30 million years (310 Ma) saw the divergence of the synapsids (including mammals) from the sauropsids (including birds and reptiles).
751:	The Triassic–Jurassic extinction event at 200 Ma spared many of the dinosaurs, and they soon became dominant among the vertebrates.
752:	60% of marine invertebrates became extinct and 25% of all families.
753:	The third mass extinction was the Permian-Triassic, or the Great Dying, event was possibly caused by some combination of the Siberian Traps volcanic event, an asteroid impact, methane hydrate gasification, sea level fluctuations, and a major anoxic event.
754:	This was by far the deadliest extinction ever, with about 57% of all families and 83% of all genera killed.
755:	By the early Paleocene the earth recovered from the extinction, and mammalian diversity increased.
756:	Grassless savanna began to predominate much of the landscape, and mammals such as Andrewsarchus rose up to become the largest known terrestrial predatory mammal ever, and early whales like Basilosaurus took control of the seas.
757:	Giant ungulates like Paraceratherium and Deinotherium evolved to rule the grasslands.
758:	The Tethys Sea was closed off by the collision of Africa and Europe.
759:	The land bridge allowed the isolated creatures of South America to migrate over to North America, and vice versa.
760:	The ice ages led to the evolution of modern man in Saharan Africa and expansion.
761:	It is believed by many that a huge migration took place along Beringia which is why, today, there are camels (which evolved and became extinct in North America), horses (which evolved and became extinct in North America), and Native Americans.
762:	Brain size increased rapidly, and by 2 Ma, the first animals classified in the genus Homo had appeared.
763:	The ability to control fire probably began in Homo erectus (or Homo ergaster), probably at least 790,000 years ago but perhaps as early as 1.5 Ma.
764:	It is more difficult to establish the origin of language; it is unclear whether Homo erectus could speak or if that capability had not begun until Homo sapiens.
765:	Social skills became more complex, language became more sophisticated, and tools became more elaborate.
766:	The first humans to show signs of spirituality are the Neanderthals (usually classified as a separate species with no surviving descendants); they buried their dead, often with no sign of food or tools.
767:	As language became more complex, the ability to remember and communicate information resulted, according to a theory proposed by Richard Dawkins, in a new replicator: the meme.
768:	Between 8500 and 7000 BC, humans in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals: agriculture.
769:	However, among those civilizations that did adopt agriculture, the relative stability and increased productivity provided by farming allowed the population to expand.
770:	This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC.
771:	Humans no longer had to spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc.).
772:	By around 500 BC, there were advanced civilizations in the Middle East, Iran, India, China, and Greece, at times expanding, at times entering into decline.
773:	This civilization developed in warfare, arts, science, mathematics and in architect.
774:	The Roman Empire was Christianized by Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century and declined by the end of the 5th.

778:	From 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945, nations around the world were embroiled in world wars.
779:	After the war, many new states were formed, declaring or being granted independence in a period of decolonization.
780:	Technological developments include nuclear weapons, computers, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.
781:	Major concerns and problems such as disease, war, poverty, violent radicalism, and recently, human-caused climate change have risen as the world population increases.
782:	Human history, or recorded history, is the narrative of humanity's past.
783:	The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin, between 10,000 and 5000 BCE, in the Near East's Fertile Crescent.
784:	As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons.
785:	Hinduism developed in the late Bronze Age on the Indian subcontinent.
786:	Post-classical history (the "Middle Ages," c. 500–1500 CE,) witnessed the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age (c. 750 CE – c. 1258 CE), and the Timurid and Italian Renaissances (from around 1300 CE).
787:	By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the late modern period, which started around 1800 and has continued through the present.
788:	Anatomically modern humans arose in Africa about 300,000 years ago, and achieved behavioral modernity about 50,000 years ago.
789:	Perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago, but certainly by 500,000 years ago, humans began to use fire for heat and cooking.
790:	Paleolithic humans lived as hunter-gatherers, and were generally nomadic.
791:	The rapid expansion of humankind to North America and Oceania took place at the climax of the most recent ice age.
792:	The Yellow River valley in China cultivated millet and other cereal crops by about 7000 BCE; the Yangtze valley domesticated rice earlier, by at least 8000 BCE.
793:	Metalworking, was first used in the creation of copper tools and ornaments around 6000 BCE.
794:	Cities were centres of trade, manufacturing and political power.
795:	The development of cities was synonymous with the rise of civilization.
796:	These cultures variously invented the wheel, mathematics, bronze-working, sailing boats, the potter's wheel, woven cloth, construction of monumental buildings, and writing.
797:	Typical of the Neolithic was a tendency to worship anthropomorphic deities.
798:	These settlements were concentrated in fertile river valleys: the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in China.
799:	Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs, whose pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract.
800:	Transport was facilitated by waterways—by rivers and seas.
801:	These developments led to the rise of territorial states and empires.
802:	In Crete the Minoan civilization had entered the Bronze Age by 2700 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.
803:	Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world.
804:	In India, this era was the Vedic period (1750-600 BCE), which laid the foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 6th century BCE.
805:	During the formative stage in Mesoamerica (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru.
806:	Karl Jaspers' Axial-Age theory also includes Persian Zoroastrianism, but other scholars dispute his timeline for Zoroastrianism.)
807:	These were Taoism, Legalism, and Confucianism.
808:	The great empires depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres.
809:	There were a number of regional empires during this period.
810:	The Median Empire gave way to successive Iranian empires, including the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE), the Parthian Empire (247 BCE–224 CE), and the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE).
811:	Later, Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE), of Macedon, founded an empire of conquest, extending from present-day Greece to present-day India.
812:	From the 3rd century CE, the Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden Age.
813:	The ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of Hindu culture in the 4th and 5th centuries.
814:	By the time of Augustus (63 BCE – 14 CE), the first Roman Emperor, Rome had already established dominion over most of the Mediterranean.
815:	The Western empire would fall, in 476 CE, to German influence under Odoacer.
816:	The Han dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the Silk Road.
817:	As with other empires during the Classical Period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, mathematics, astronomy, technology, and many others.
818:	Successful regional empires were also established in the Americas, arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE.
819:	The great Mayan city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the Yucatán and surrounding areas.
820:	There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress.
821:	China's Han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 CE, beginning the Three Kingdoms period, while its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the Crisis of the Third Century.
822:	The development of the stirrup and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations.
823:	The remaining part of the Roman Empire, in the eastern Mediterranean, continued as what came to be called the Byzantine Empire.
824:	The era is commonly dated from the 5th-century fall of the Western Roman Empire, which fragmented into many separate kingdoms, some of which would later be confederated under the Holy Roman Empire.
825:	South Asia saw a series of middle kingdoms of India, followed by the establishment of Islamic empires in India.
826:	This allowed Africa to join the Southeast Asia trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this, along with Muslim culture, resulted in the Swahili culture.
827:	This was also a cultural battle, with the Byzantine Hellenistic and Christian culture competing against the Persian Iranian traditions and Zoroastrian religion.
828:	From their centre on the Arabian Peninsula, Muslims began their expansion during the early Postclassical Era.
829:	Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography.
830:	The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous.
831:	Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, European leaders launched a number of Crusades to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the Holy Land.
832:	Arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the Seljuq Turks, migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia.
833:	The region will later be called the Barbary Coast and will host pirates and privateers who will use several North African ports for their raids against the coastal towns of several European countries in search of slaves to be sold in North African markets as part of the Barbary slave trade.
834:	In the 8th century, Islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population, though Buddhism remained strong in the east.
835:	After Genghis Khan died in 1227, most of Central Asia continued to be dominated by a successor state, Chagatai Khanate.

837:	The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire.
838:	Christianity expanded in western Europe, and monasteries were founded.
839:	Manorialism, the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles, and feudalism, a political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and manors, were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages.
840:	Italian merchants imported slaves to work in households or in sugar processing.

846:	The ninth century saw a Tripartite Struggle for control of northern India, among the Pratihara Empire, the Pala Empire, and the Rashtrakuta Empire.
847:	The Tang dynasty eventually splintered, however, and after half a century of turmoil the Song dynasty reunified China, when it was, according to William McNeill, the "richest, most skilled, and most populous country on earth".
848:	After about a century of Mongol Yuan dynasty rule, the ethnic Chinese reasserted control with the founding of the Ming dynasty (1368).
849:	The Nara period of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state and is often portrayed as a golden age.
850:	The feudal period of Japanese history, dominated by powerful regional lords (daimyos) and the military rule of warlords (shoguns) such as the Ashikaga shogunate and Tokugawa shogunate, stretched from 1185 to 1868.
851:	Silla conquered Baekje in 660, and Goguryeo in 668, marking the beginning of the Northern and Southern States period (남북국시대), with Unified Silla in the south and Balhae, a successor state to Goguryeo, in the north.
852:	Starting in the 9th century, the Bagan Kingdom rose to prominence in modern Myanmar.

859:	It had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1000 CE.
860:	It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production, piston bellows, suspension bridge construction, printing, and the compass.
861:	One theory of Europe's rise holds that Europe's geography played an important role in its success.
862:	This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders.
863:	The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258.

867:	Technological advance and the wealth generated by trade gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.
868:	Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly—given the continent's geography—was largely the work of its Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands.

874:	The Johor Sultanate, centred on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region.
875:	Russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of North America, with a first colony in present-day Alaska in 1784, and the outpost of Fort Ross in present-day California in 1812.
876:	The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and used new modes of production—the factory, mass production, and mechanization—to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required.
877:	After Europeans had achieved influence and control over the Americas, imperial activities turned to the lands of Asia and Oceania.
878:	The British also colonized Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies.
879:	Within Europe, economic and military challenges created a system of nation states, and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy.
880:	Meanwhile, industrial pollution and environmental damage, present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization, accelerated drastically.
881:	Much of the rest of the world was influenced by heavily Europeanized nations: the United States and Japan.
882:	World War I led to the collapse of four empires – Austria-Hungary, the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire – and weakened the United Kingdom and France.
883:	Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, helped precipitate World War II.
884:	The Cold War ended peacefully in 1991 after the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent fall of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the Warsaw Pact.
885:	In the early postwar decades, the colonies in Asia and Africa of the Belgian, British, Dutch, French, and other west European empires won their formal independence.
886:	The European Union's effectiveness was handicapped by the immaturity of its common economic and political institutions, somewhat comparable to the inadequacy of United States institutions under the Articles of Confederation prior to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States that came into force in 1789.
887:	In the decades after World War II, these advances led to jet travel, artificial satellites with innumerable applications including the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the Internet.
888:	Worldwide competition for natural resources has risen due to growing populations and industrialization, especially in India, China, and Brazil.
889:	An archive is an accumulation of historical records – in any media – or the physical facility in which they are located.
890:	They have been metaphorically defined as "the secretions of an organism", and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity.
891:	This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.
892:	Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like Ebla, Mari, Amarna, Hattusas, Ugarit, and Pylos.
893:	However, they have been lost, since documents written on materials like papyrus and paper deteriorated at a faster pace, unlike their stone tablet counterparts.
894:	England after 1066 developed archives and archival research methods.
895:	While there are many kinds of archives, the most recent census of archivists in the United States identifies five major types: academic, business (for profit), government, non-profit, and other.
896:	Access to the collections in these archives is usually by prior appointment only; some have posted hours for making inquiries.
897:	Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include Coca-Cola (which also owns the separate museum World of Coca-Cola), Procter and Gamble, Motorola Heritage Services and Archives, and Levi Strauss & Co.

903:	Often these institutions rely on grant funding from the government as well as the private funds.
904:	Many museums keep archives in order to prove the provenance of their pieces.
905:	This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.
906:	The archive's mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves, and want their stories heard.
907:	The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes.
908:	Many of these donations have yet to be cataloged, but are currently in the process of being digitally preserved and made available to the public online.
909:	International partners for archives are UNESCO and Blue Shield International in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999.
910:	Page, Morgan M. "One from the Vaults: Gossip, Access, and Trans History-Telling."
911:	An example of this is Morgan M. Page’s description of disseminating transgender history directly to trans people through various social media and networking platforms like tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as via podcast.
912:	With the options available through counter-archiving, there is the potential to "challenge traditional conceptions of history" as they are perceived within contemporary archives, which creates space for narratives that are often not present in many archival materials.
913:	A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life.
914:	Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life.
915:	Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is De vita Caesarum ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by Suetonius, written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor Hadrian.
916:	Hermits, monks, and priests used this historic period to write biographies.
917:	One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the life of Charlemagne by his courtier Einhard.
918:	They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period.
919:	By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of kings, knights, and tyrants began to appear.
920:	Following Malory, the new emphasis on humanism during the Renaissance promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.
921:	Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the printing press in the 15th century and the gradual increase in literacy.
922:	Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, A General History of the Pyrates (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.
923:	Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions.
924:	Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character – a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.
925:	However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public.
926:	Periodicals began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.
927:	Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality.
928:	The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.
929:	Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the cortège of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism."
930:	The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.
931:	Robert Graves (I, Claudius, 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies."
932:	By World War I, cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular.
933:	Along with documentary biographical films, Hollywood produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people.
934:	Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles.
935:	General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.
936:	The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials".
937:	European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes.
938:	Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.
939:	In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged.
940:	These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts.
941:	Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls.
942:	Feudalism was the link between a lord and his vassal where, in return for military service and the expectation of loyalty, the lord would grant the vassal land.
943:	Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic.
944:	As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken.
945:	A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.
946:	In different areas of the world, analogous structures shared features of fortification and other defining characteristics associated with the concept of a castle, though they originated in different periods and circumstances and experienced differing evolutions and influences.
947:	By the 16th century, when Japanese and European cultures met, fortification in Europe had moved beyond castles and relied on innovations such as the Italian trace italienne and star forts.
948:	The excavation of earth to make the mound left a ditch around the motte, called a moat (which could be either wet or dry).
949:	It was a common feature of castles, and most had at least one.
950:	Water was supplied by a well or cistern.
951:	Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could also be found as independent defensive structures.
952:	Keep" was not a term used in the medieval period – the term was applied from the 16th century onwards – instead "donjon" was used to refer to great towers, or turris in Latin.
953:	Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in case of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.
954:	Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies below, and battlements gave them further protection.
955:	The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added on each side of the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.
956:	The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.
957:	They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them.
958:	A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.
959:	The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls.
960:	Many earthworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches.
961:	Although primitive, they were often effective, and were only overcome by the extensive use of siege engines and other siege warfare techniques, such as at the Battle of Alesia.
962:	Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence.
963:	Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.
964:	Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.
965:	Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands.
966:	In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed.
967:	Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country.
968:	In 950 Provence was home to 12 castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.
969:	In the early 11th century, the motte and keep – an artificial mound with a palisade and tower on top – was the most common form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia.
970:	Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11th century onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, while at the same time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.
971:	Before the 12th century castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the Norman Conquest.
972:	Their decoration emulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers.
973:	Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles were by no means useless.
974:	Until the late 12th century castles generally had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures).
975:	The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.
976:	Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical.
977:	Probably developed in the 12th century, the towers provided flanking fire.
978:	It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture.
979:	Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche, in France.
980:	The castle builders of Western Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design; late Roman coastal forts on the English "Saxon Shore" were reused and in Spain the wall around the city of Ávila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.
981:	An example of this approach is Kerak.
982:	The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons.
983:	While castles were used to hold a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.
984:	Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences.
985:	If assailants made it past the first line of defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.
986:	For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure.
987:	Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders.
988:	Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.
989:	Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form.
990:	Conflict and interaction between the two groups led to an exchange of architectural ideas, and Spanish Christians adopted the use of detached towers.
991:	French historian François Gebelin wrote: "The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of William the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy.
992:	The new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created such as that of Raglan in Wales.
993:	These guns were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon.
994:	This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands.
995:	Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits – allowing only lateral movement – and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.
996:	Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.
997:	In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles.
998:	While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon.
999:	A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from.
